# AndroidMalwareLabeling

This repository contains the source code and Jupyter notebooks for a bachelor thesis `Labeling of Android Malware with Help of Cryptographic API Usage`.
The thesis focused on malware detection, adware detection, malware family labeling, and adware family labeling for Android applications written in Java.
All of the experiments (in Jupyter notebooks) in the repository use a fixed seed and can be re-run or even executed with different dataset.
Additionally, the source code can be tweaked/used for other other experiments.

## Repository Structure

- `data` - a folder containing the data from AndroZoo (because of licensing issues only hashes are available)
- `android_malware_labeling` - a folder containing source code written in Python that can be reused for other experiments
- `notebooks` - a folder containing the Jupyter notebooks used for the experiments
- `results` - a folder containing the results of analysis and evaluation
- `LICENSE` - MIT license for the source code
- `requirements.txt` - a text file describing the Python packages necessary for the experiments

For a more detailed description of the folders, please refer to the nested README.md file in the given folder.
